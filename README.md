## Technologies and Tools used in the Project
- Python: a high-level programming language that is widely used for web development and machine learning.
- Django: a high-level Python web framework that is used to build dynamic and scalable websites.
- WebRTC (Agora): a real-time communication protocol that is used to establish communication between users.
- Mediapipe Hands: a hand tracking solution used to detect and estimate the positions of hands in real-time.
- Keras: a high-level neural network library that is used to build deep learning models.
- Teachable Machine: a machine learning tool that enables users to train custom machine learning models without writing any code.

## Project Summary
The project is a Django website that allows users to play a Rock-Paper-Scissors game either offline or online. In offline mode, users can play against the computer, while in online mode, they can play against an opponent using the WebRTC protocol.

The hand gestures of the player are captured in real-time using the Agora video platform and processed using the Mediapipe Hands solution for hand tracking and skeleton estimation. The captured hand gestures are then cropped and fed into a custom machine learning model that was developed using the Keras library and trained with Teachable Machine.

This project showcases the integration of several technologies to create an interactive and engaging user experience. The WebRTC protocol enables real-time communication between players, while the Mediapipe Hands solution accurately tracks hand gestures. The custom machine learning model, developed using Keras and trained with Teachable Machine, ensures accurate predictions of the game's outcome.

In conclusion, the project combines the use of Python, Django, WebRTC, Agora, Mediapipe Hands, Keras, and Teachable Machine to deliver a unique Rock-Paper-Scissors gaming experience for users.
